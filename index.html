                        <p class="p p1">Printing this famous line has become the symbol of possibility to first-time programming students everywhere around the globe. Its meaning is as simple as it is thrilling: no matter who you are, no matter your language, ethnicity, or background, the computer understood the instructions you gave it and executed them successfully. In the Information era the skill of translating vision into reality efficiently and accurately is highly prized. Just like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road" target="_blank" title="Silk Road">Silk Road </a>of ancient times, which facilitated commerce by building infrastructure, today, creating spaces for communication, exchange of ideas, and collabarative work is the key to success in the ever-changing global socioeconomic landscape.</p>

                    <p class="p p4">Literature has always been of interest to me. Learning to communicate is among the very first skills children learn. Stories by the fire-side feed imaginations and dreams. Where did man first fly, if not in a <a class="Icarus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus" target="_blank" title="Daedalus">myth</a></span>? As a result language helps pass down lessons learnt which, when implemented, improve the efficiency of work and benefit populations as a whole. Writing instructions for machines is no different. So remember everytime you open up your IDE and sit down to transcribe thoughts into realities, you are participating in a tradition that has been around for millenia.</p>
